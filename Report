#Understanding Data
As with any modelling process, it is imperative to assess the data to get a sense of the explanatory variables and the data itself. With housing prices, we have two datasets: Train.csv and Test.csv. Here are the features that I explored the structure and summary of data with an initial eye:
•	Train has 1,460 observations and Test has 1,459 observations
•	Train has 81 variables including Sale prices and test has 80 variables (actual sale prices have been removed from test set)
•	There are quite a few NAs, some are genuine as has been mentioned in the data dictionary, such NA for Pool Quality (PoolQC) means the house does not have a pool. While others are real missing values which would need to be dealt with.
•	Missing values are found across both categorical and numerical variables and in both datasets.
•	Some errors in the observations that need fixing.

After getting a general idea, I decided to approach this in 3 steps which can be broadly categorized as follows:
1.	Data Cleaning, Exploration and Feature Engineering: This allowed me to dig deep beyond the surface and look for ways to clean and prepare the data for modelling. It included visualizations to look for patterns, outliers, and any skewness. 
2.	Regression Modelling: Once the data was prepared, I decided to run regression models to assess the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) and other metrics.
3.	Re-assessing and Modifying Models: This step involved narrowing down the models to get one that provided the best results as well as helped reach a top rank on the leadership board of the competition.
