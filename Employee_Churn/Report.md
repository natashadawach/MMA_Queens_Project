# Introduction
Employee turnover can be one of the biggest costs to a company. It is a problem that many businesses face across different industries around the globe. The reason this cost can become a huge burden is due to its several expensive components which consist of hiring, training, loss of knowledge, and loss of productivity. These costs and the ripple effect on existing employees call for businesses’ interest in exploring factors for turnover and pre-planning the retention programs such that the turnovers can be minimized.
In this report, I will explore classification model that can predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company or not. This information will be used by the higher management and the HR to strategize a retention plan for risky employees for reasons that are controllable by the company. Essentially, once these employees are identified by the model, management would provide benefits/remedies to these employees so that they can be retained. The cost of employee churn is higher than the cost of providing the retention benefits, hence, if the employees are retained, the costs are minimized.
While the accuracy of the chosen model is imperative, the success of this project is also heavily dependent on how robust the retention plan is once the model has made its predictions. Nonetheless, the model will play a key role in determining the probability of churn, which can assist the company in their overall planning and preparedness for employee churn events.


# Retention Plan 
As many retention plans will cost the firm time and money, it is essential to pinpoint both when the firm will intervene and for which employees. Taking a broad approach to retention may provide value by reducing overall attrition rates, but it could potentially end up costing more than not intervening at all. A firm needs to define how they want to operate given their specific goals, and the circumstances within their business. To assist, I researched multiple ways that other businesses are trying to solve this problem and will attempt to quantify these methods to evaluate their effectiveness. 
I will also assess if any intervention method is worth implementing for this specific employer.
Ongoing Education
Employees are 80% more likely to stay with a business when given the chance to advance their education to learn new skills outside of the business (Florentine, 2019). Applying this methodology to the business problem outlined throughout this analysis could potentially increase the likelihood of employees staying with the business. The business would likely have to have a yearly cap on available funds by employee, and specific criteria for qualification. 
For this scenario, I relied on information reported by the Wall Street Journal that 10% of employees utilize tuition reimbursement programs (Berman, 2018). When assessing the data, we notice that the turnover for employees having a higher education than a bachelor’s degree is relatively lower than the ones who hold bachelor’s degree. This can be seen in the graph below as well. For example, laboratory technicians with bachelor’s degree seem to have the highest number of turnovers. ABC company, in such scenarios, can offer a tuition reimbursement programs to its employees for their growth within the company. Furthermore, I capped the yearly total reimbursement at $2000. These can be specifically targeted at employees who have a probability of less than 50% of churning based on the model predictions. This is because these employees have a relatively low probability of leaving, and with a success rate of 80% of this strategy, it is very likely that the company will be able to retain most employees in this category at a cost of $2,000.
 
**Permanent Flexibility** 
Another potential option to increase employee retention is to provide folks with the flexibility to choose their hours and location as this is in line with 88% of knowledge worker’s expectations (Minahan, 2021). In addition, research from Stanford postulates that providing employees the opportunity to work from home can reduce turnover by 50% (Fanning, 2017). As this trend is being spoken about more than ever, it may be a valuable option for the business in this case to ensure they proactively offer this option to employees.
From the dataset, we can compare employees who are churning based business travel. We notice that employees who tend to travel rarely have a higher turnover number across all departments than the other two categories. We believe this has to do with the expectations from the job. It is possible that these employees were not expecting to travel on business based on their roles, but when they must travel on rare occasion, they do not prefer. When we compare these to employees who are travelling frequently, we notice frequent travelers are not churning as much as rare travelers, perhaps because their job descriptions and job role entails that it is a travel heavy role. Since the expectations are aligned, the turnover in this case is low. As it is generally viewed as a cost savings for the business to have folks working remotely (Silvermann, 2020), I will ascribe a value of $0 for this comparison.
 
**Defined Career Path**
I’s final potential intervention method involves defining a career path for employees. Chamberlain (2017) postulates that up to 73% of job transitions were driven by employees targeting the next role for career progression. If the firm in question could help to clarify career paths for employees, they may be able to increase retention rates and lower the costs associated with turnover. This is especially true in more junior roles where employee turnout rates are highest according to the findings of this analysis. From the data itself, I analyzes that for different job roles, a more senior job level reduces the employee turnover to a great extent. 
For this to have any merit a firm must be entirely onboard with the idea as it will take coordination between various stakeholders to define the framework for career advancement throughout the organization. Recognizing that this cultural shift may be very challenging, I suggests targeting the areas with the highest attrition for management and human resources to create framework for progression. Relying on an example by Cowpe (2021), this type of project can take a month or more with a dedicated project manager depending on the level of granularity and the pre-existing conditions at the business. To keep within the scope of this project, I benchmarked the cost using the average monthly wage from the data set of $6,502.93. If the results are in line with Chamberlain’s (2017) findings, the company can expect 73% of folks who are predicted to leave to end up staying if the intervention targeted their area. 

**Travel Rewards**
Targeted employee retention efforts that recognize employees can help increase employee retention by 41% (Achievers, 2021). An important factor is getting the intervention right for your workforce. The model findings suggest that employee travel rewards would be effective for this group. ABC company could implement yearly all-inclusive trips that allow a guest to join. The max cost per employee can be targeted at $3000. In addition, travel rewards can be an effective motivator for workforces (Heathfield, 2019), which could lead to addition positives for the firm. It is most likely best to use this approach for sales related employees as it can be tied directly to a sales target. This would limit the overall cost to ABC, but also allow for clearly defined, fair goals between employees.

**Pro-active Approach**
The company can also reduce the productivity loss by being pro-active in hiring in advance as a replacement for those employees who have a 90% and higher probability of leaving the company. This is because as per our model, there is a low success rate of retaining these employees (discussed in detail in later section of Business objective and result alignment). Although this not a retention strategy, it can still help the company in reducing its overall costs.

# Business Objective and Result Alignment
Our business objective is to prevent employee churn by offering them incentives in line with our retention policies so that the company can save at least $35,000 in the year when the model is deployed. With the help of our modelling techniques, we can determine the probability of an employee’s churn as well as those who are on the fence and would churn if no intervention is made. Based on our model predictions we are considering a 3-pronged approach to retention:
1.	If the probability of churn is less than 50%, we consider this group of employees as having a low possibility of churn. These employees fall under a range where the probability is closer to the threshold of 28%, which increases the risk of them being false positives i.e., the model predicts that these employees would quit but, in actuality, most of them may not quit. Additionally, those employees that may actually quit at this low range of probabilities perhaps have some excruciating reasons for leaving. In order to anchor the company against the false positive flags as well as retain those employees who truly plan to leave, the company can reserve/allocate a retention strategy of $2,000 (such as ongoing education package or flexibility strategy) for this group. The company can even take the risk of waiting till the interest of resignation is shared from this group (instead of offering a plan in advance) so that the retention plan is not offered to false-positives, and those who put forth the interest of resignation are retained at a very high success rate. The success rate is considered high because the probability of churn is already low and once the company intervenes, the probability of churn is estimated to go further down.
2.	If the probability of churn is in between 50%-90%, we will offer them a retention plan in advance, as soon as the model makes predictions. This is because these individuals have a probability of churning that is neither too high nor too low. This means that if an appropriate retention plan is offered pro-actively, this lot can change its decision of quitting, in other words, ABC company has a better chance of influencing the decision of churn for this category of employees. Therefore, our analysis from the model validation as well as research suggest that these individuals have a higher chance of being retained hence the success rate of retention plan for this category is high. From the above-mentioned retention plans, the company can give out the most expensive retention package to this lot to change their decisions in ABC’s favour.
3.	If the probability of churn is over 90%, these employees would most likely churn. A retention plan for this group may not be very successful because this lot has most likely made up their minds to leave. They may also have interviewed in other companies and have standing offers. At such a high probability of churn, even an expensive retention plan may not change their decisions. Nonetheless, ABC can still offer them incentives from the more expensive retention schemes as a last resort. This package will be offered once the intention of resignation is put forth to avoid employees taking up retention strategy and leaving right after, thereby increasing the costs of the company.
